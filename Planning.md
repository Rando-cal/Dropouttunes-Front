From the main page a user can log in or create a new account. No nav links will be displayed on this page so that a user can not do anything on the site without logging in. 
Once a user is logged in they will be brought to the main page which will have a search bar to allow user to search for individual songs with an image below to cover the blank space on the page. When the search results load the image will hide and the results will populate below the search bar displaying the track name and artist of each result with a + next to it for the user to add to cart.
On the top of the main page and every other with the exception of the login page, there will be a header/navbar that includes links for home, settings(which will be where the user can change their password), logout and cart with the number of items in their cart displayed next to that.
On the bottom of those pages will be a footer with our logo and the purpose of the page they are currently on ex.(Search page, Track Info, Logout, Cart)
